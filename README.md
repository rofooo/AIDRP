# AIDRP (AI-Based Dynamic Routing Protocol)

AIDRP is a next-generation routing protocol that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize network routing decisions, offering superior performance compared to traditional protocols like OSPF and BGP.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Path Computation**: Uses machine learning models to predict optimal paths based on network conditions
- **Predictive Traffic Engineering**: Anticipates network congestion and adjusts routes proactively
- **Fast Convergence**: Achieves significantly faster convergence than traditional protocols through ML-based predictions
- **QoS-Aware Routing**: Intelligently routes traffic based on application requirements and network conditions
- **Automated Policy Optimization**: Self-tunes routing policies based on network performance metrics
- **Enhanced Security**: Built-in anomaly detection and mitigation mechanisms

## Architecture

The protocol consists of several key components:

1. **Topology Manager**: Maintains and updates network topology information
2. **AI Engine**: Handles ML model training and inference for path computation
3. **Route Calculator**: Computes optimal routes based on AI predictions
4. **State Monitor**: Tracks link states and network conditions
5. **Policy Engine**: Manages and optimizes routing policies
6. **Security Module**: Handles threat detection and mitigation
